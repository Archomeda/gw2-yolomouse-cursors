# Guild Wars 2 icons for YoloMouse

Anybody who has played Guild Wars 2, has probably come across the problem where
you lose track of your mouse cursor. Maybe not as frequent as me, but most
likely at least once. If you're frustrated by this, then using
[YoloMouse](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/) is an option, in
combination with these modified Guild Wars 2 cursors. Be sure to read the
[tutorial](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/help.html) on how to add
custom cursors.

In the 'cursors' folder, you can find different packs. If you want, you can
create your own pack by taking the images from the 'originals' folder. An easy
way to create cursor files is by using
[RealWorld Cursor Editor](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-maker).
If you have created your own cursor pack, please share them by submitting a pull
request.

Please note that I do not own the copyright of both the original images and the
modified ones; the copyright will always belong to ArenaNet. I provide these
images to the community for free, in the hope that it will help some people to
keep track of their mouse cursor.
