# Guild Wars 2 cursors for YoloMouse
Anybody who has played Guild Wars 2, has probably come across the problem where you lose track of your mouse cursor. Maybe not as frequent as me, but most likely at least once.
If you're frustrated by this, then using [YoloMouse](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/) is an option, in combination with these modified Guild Wars 2 cursors.
Be sure to read the [YoloMouse tutorial](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/help.html) about how to add custom cursors, which will not be explained here.

**Please note** that I do *not* own the copyright of the original nor the modified ones; the copyright will always belong to ArenaNet.
I provide these images to the community for free, in the hope that it will help some people to keep track of their mouse cursor.

## How to use
Guild Wars 2 offers cursors in 4 sizes: 32px, 64px, 96px and 128px.
Currently, only the old 32px variants are included in these cursor packs.

 1. Download the cursors by pressing the *Download ZIP* button at the top right corner of this page (or alternatively, you can [click here](https://github.com/Archomeda/gw2-yolomouse-cursors/archive/master.zip))
 2. Extract it any folder
 3. Choose a cursor pack inside the *cursors* folder (you can preview them on GitHub itself by opening the folder here and scrolling down)
 4. Copy these files to YoloMouse in its *Cursors* folder (e.g. `C:\ProgramÂ Files\YoloMouse\Cursors`)
 5. Restart YoloMouse and Guild Wars 2 if needed
 6. Assign the cursors to each in-game cursor by using `CtrlÂ +Â AltÂ +Â ShiftÂ +Â <NUM>`, where `<NUM>` is 4 for cursors in the 30-39 range, 5 for cursors in the 40-49 range, etc.; keep pressing the same key combination to cycle through the cursors in a range

## Creating your own cursors
If you want, you can create your own pack by taking the images from the *originals* folder.
An easy way to create cursor files is by using [RealWorld Cursor Editor](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-maker).

## FAQ
- *I don't want to go through the effort of assigning all the cursors myself!*  
  Well, you're lucky.
  YoloMouse saves the cursor assignments on your hard drive, and we can share that.
  In your `%LOCALAPPDATA%\YoloMouse` folder, there should be a file called after Guild Wars 2, something like `*__Gw2_exe.ini` or `*__Gw2_64_exe.ini` where the asterisk can be anything.
  Open it, copy the assignments in the `assignments.ini` file of the cursor pack, and paste it in the opened .ini file, replacing everything else.

- *I can't assign any cursors in the 64-bit client, how can I get YoloMouse to work?*  
  Apparently there seems to be an issue for some people that can't get the cursors to work in the 64-bit client.
  As mentioned in [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3xlakx/customized_guild_wars_2_cursors_for_yolomouse/cy5sfos?context=10000), you can solve this issue by hovering over the patcher window, and pressing `CtrlÂ +Â AltÂ +Â ShiftÂ +Â 1`.
  After the game has started up, repeat this.
  You can now assign the custom cursors to the Guild Wars 2 cursors.

- *The cursor size doesn't match the original Guild Wars 2 ones, or look blurry or pixelated*  
  If this happens, then it's possible that the cursor size is not configured properly.
  To solve this, scale the cursor up or down until it looks alright by using  `CtrlÂ +Â AltÂ +Â ShiftÂ +Â -` or `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + +` respectively.

- *I still don't know what's going on* ðŸ˜•  
  WoodenPotatoes has made a great [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W6dSRh2axY) about YoloMouse and these cursors
  He explains in detail on how to install both YoloMouse and these custom cursors.
